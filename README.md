# Pizza :pizza:

For this project I built a web application for Pinocchio's Pizza.
Customers can view the menu, create an account and order their favorite meals.
A superuser account with username "Pinocchio" and password "Pizza", allows the company to add or remove menu items, and to see the pending orders.
As an extra feature, completed orders can be removed from the pending orders list.
